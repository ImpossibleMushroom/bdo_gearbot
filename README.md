# bdo_gearbot
A gear and node war bot for BDO
**Archived:** This repo has been archived. I haven't touched it for years. The code out of date and messy and even buggy but I keep it up because some people seem to still view/star it on occasion.

# Open sourced gear bot for BDO Guilds
This is a gear bot for Black Desert Online Guilds it works via Discord, it requires MongoDB and NodeJS. When deployed on services using ephemeral file systems the `config.js` may have issues with file based configs.
Please open issues or submit pull requests as you like, all help is welcomed.

Current goal is to just get a working product for my guild to use, I do not plan on adding much room for customization or public support for a while to come as I am currently just building it with my guild in mind.

# Feature Goals
This bot's job is to hold and manage guild members guild's for easy access and provide a form of automation for Guild leaders and officers. This guild also aims to take some co-ordination stress off of guilds who wish to do Nodewars by automating as much as possible. *(Of course this is purely community work and the bot **at no point** will interact with Black Desert Online itself.)*
